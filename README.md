Analyses were conducted to visualize the relationship between city latitudes and maximum temperature, humidity, cloudiness, and wind speed. Primary analyses were conducted to look at the overall relationship, and secondary analyses were conducted to examine the relationships when cities were separated based on if they were in the northern or southern hemisphere. These secondary analyses have also been included to provide further context and information about the findings of this project.

This website was created using HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap. Pandas was used to convert the pandas dataframe from the previous assignment to an HTML table, and Bootstrap table components were used to make the table responsive.
